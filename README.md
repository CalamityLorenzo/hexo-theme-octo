A Hexo theme based on the classic Octopress 2 skin.


Notes; WIP
----------

CSS is compiled; there's no SASS source.

Supports images with classes 'left', 'right' and 'center'.

- how to make pages work?
- different social things?
- disqus
- google analytics
- github component?

Uses 'tags' for what were 'categories' (in Hexo, categories are hierarchical: so a page with '[cooking, french]' will be understood as belonging to
category cooking, subcategory french cooking).

Social stuff
- supports twitter sharing only, at present
