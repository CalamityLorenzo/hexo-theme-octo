A Hexo theme based on the classic Octopress 2 skin.


Notes; WIP
----------

CSS is compiled; there's no SASS source.

- how to make pages work?
- different social things?
- disqus
- google analytics
- github component?

Uses 'tags' for what were 'categories' (in Hexo, categories are hierarchical: so a page with '[cooking, french]' will be understood as belonging to
category cooking, subcategory french cooking).

Social stuff
- supports twitter sharing only, at present

What works?
- blockquotes
- code blocks
- images (left / right / center)
- gists
- headings
- pullquotes (left, right [= default])
- jsfiddle embeds
- youtube videos
